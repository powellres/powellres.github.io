This was a project started in a workshop in 2020 through the CIMAT summer system and involved a presentation in the 61st annual conference of the Western Regional Science Association.\n\n\n\nProjects\n\nBig Data (DSAN 6000) Final Project\nLink to Deliverable | Github | December 2024\nSkills: Python, SQL, Spark, SparkSQL, SparkNLP, Spark ML, AWS, Azure, Git, Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, and Data Visualization\nSummary: We created a website that had exploratory data analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning aspects all applied to a 100 GB dataset of reddit data. For this project I specifically found a subset of the data where US States were mentioned, created visualizations of this dataset, found the sentiment associated with each state, and created a machine learning model to predict the score of the post based on all the variables.\n\n\nNatural Language Processing (DSAN 5800) Final Project\nLink to Deliverable | Github | December 2024\nSkills: Python, Huggingface, Git, and Data Wrangling\nSummary: For this project we created a presentation and report (which is in the github) on the use of various retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods which had the goal of finding cases relevant to a search. Large Language models normally have a problem with hallucinating results and RAG is a method to sidestep that issue.\n\n\nElection Night Dashboard\nLink to Deliverable | Github | November 2024\n\n\n\nPhoto showing an instance of the dashboard\n\n\nSkills: R, Shiny dasboards, Data wrangling and cleaning, API querying, Data Visualization, ggplot2, and Plotly\nSummary: A Dashboard made in R for the Mecklenburg County Democrats in Charlotte, NC. We were working with them in 2024 during the election and they wanted a way to review their results and compare them to the 2020 and 2022 election seasons. The Dashboard was made in R using Shiny and Plotly to make the interactive graphs.\n\n\nReturning Student Scholarship\nLink to Deliverable | Github | June 2024\nSkills: R, ggplot2 and Plotly, Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, Clustering, Tableau, and Regression\nSummary: When entering the second year of my two year program they gave the students a chance to compete for a merit-based scholarship through projects we make and our contributions to the program. We submitted a project based on soil water retention data from a study on Natural Bridges National Park. I submitted my project and won the second highest prize for my work.\n\n\nNueral Networks (DSAN 6600) Final Project\nLink to Deliverable | Github | May 2024\nSkills: Python, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Convolutional and Artifical Nerual Networks, Git, Pandas, and Data Wrangling\nSummary: For this group project we took a dataset of item from Amazon (found on Kaggle) which had price and an image of the product. We fit a convolutional neural network to the images in order to predict the price of the product itself. In this process we transformed and permutated the original images to better train the model. We were midly successful with interesting results that the model tended to look at logos or other branding for information about price.\n\n\nAnalytics for Statistical Learning (DSAN 5300) Final Project\nLink to Deliverable | Github | May 2024\n\n\n\nPoster showing the results of the project\n\n\nSkills: R, Python, Artificial Neural Netowrks, Linear Regression, Geospatial mapping, Data Wrangling, and Data Visualization\nSummary: On this group project we applied out knowledge of various advance statistical methods including Artificial Neural Networks to analyze power use across estonia. In particular, I structured and ran the artificial neural networks for a regression and classification question and completed some of the initial data cleaning for the project.\n\n\nData Visualization (DSAN 5200) Final Project\nLink to Deliverable | Github | May 2024\nSkills: Python, R, Git, Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, D3\nSummary: Using crime statistics from 2018-2022, we visualized very aspects of the incidents reported as if they were featured in a clue game, as in if a crime happened to you in DC what was your relation to the perpetrator, where did it happen, and what weapon was used. Otherwise we used interactive and linked visualizations using packages like ggplot, plotly, and D3.\n\n\nIntro to Statistics (DSAN 5100) Final Project\nLink to Deliverable | Github | December 2023\nSkills: R, Data Visualization, Regression, Anova, and Predictive Analysis\nSummary: For this final project I worked alone to analyze a dataset of nobel prize winners for differences in gender over time and across the different categories. The analysis for this project was more baseline and mostly involved proving statistical independence and differences to support the thesis of my research.\n\n\nDSAN 5000 Final\nLink to Deliverable | Github | December 2023\nSkills: R, Python, Clustering, Naive Bayes, Dimensionality Reduction, Decision trees, API querying, Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis\nSummary: For this project, we were asked to pick a dataset and apply a variety of machine learning methods. I chose a public knitting database on which I cleaned the data;performed exploratory data analysis; used analysis techniques like Naive Bayes Predictive modeling, Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, and Decision trees/Random forests; and concluded the results all while documenting my code.\n\n\n\nArticles\n\nThe Swarthmore Phoenix\nThis links to all of the articles I wrote for the Swarthmore Phoenix while I was a staff writiter there. I wrote for the Campus Journal, Opinions, and Arts section. The wriritng didn’t overlap as much with my academic interests but I was happy to contribute to the periodical periodically.\n\n\nLegacy Dilemma\nInterviewed by the New York Times for an article on Legacy in the context of the end of Affirmative Action.\n\n\nFive Global Health Priorities for the future President\nWhile Interning for the Friends of the Global Fight I helped write this article published by Ambassador Mark Lagon in the American Interest"

    "text": "Hello and welcome to my website. I recent Masters graduate Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University, studying data science and analytics. I was formerly a undergraduate at Swarthmore college studying political science and statistics.\nI’m pursuing a career in the intersection of advanced data analytics and politics, bringing technical abilities to policy and progress. To this extent I have an ongoing relationship with Bluebonnet Data where volunteered as a data scientist and then was brought onto the team to help manage other volunteers during the 2024 election cycle. I am excited to continue working in the progressive tech space and hope to bring my experience with a variety of organizations forward.\nOutside of that career, I’m a avid knitter, reader, and movie buff. I’ve taken up writing in the new year and hope to continue with personal coding projects on the side mostly related to knitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowell Posing for a GradGov Headshot\n\n\n Github\n Powell.Sheagren@gmail.com\n Linkedin"
