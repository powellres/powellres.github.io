Hello and welcome to my website. I am Powell Sheagren, a recent Masters graduate Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University, studying data science and analytics. I was formerly a undergraduate at Swarthmore college where I studied political science and statistics.

I'm pursuing a career in the intersection of advanced data analytics and politics, bringing technical abilities to policy and progress. To this extent I have an ongoing relationship with Bluebonnet Data where volunteered as a data scientist for non-profits and campaigns and then was brought onto the team to help manage other volunteers during the 2024 election cycle. I am excited to continue working in the progressive and non-profit tech space and hope to bring my experience with a variety of organizations forward. 

Outside of that career, I'm a avid knitter, reader, and movie buff. I've taken up writing in the new year and hope to continue with personal coding projects on the side mostly related to knitting.
